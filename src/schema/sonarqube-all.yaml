    # SonarQube V2 API


    The SonarQube API v2 is a REST API which enables you to interact with
    SonarQube programmatically.

    While not all endpoints of the former Web API are available yet, the ones
    available are stable and can be used in production environments.

      summary: Users search
      description: |2
          Get a list of users. By default, only active users are returned.
          The following fields are only returned when user has Administer System permission or for logged-in in user :
            'email',
            'externalIdentity',
            'externalProvider',
            'groups',
            'lastConnectionDate',
            'sonarLintLastConnectionDate',
            'tokensCount'.
          Field 'sonarqubeLastConnectionDate' is only updated every hour, so it may not be accurate, for instance when a user authenticates many times in less than one hour.
          The results are sorted alphabetically by login.

      description: >
        Search for package releases that appear in the analyzed project,

        application, or portfolio, as determined by software composition
        analysis.


        This endpoint returns one result for each release,

        rather than one result for each time a release is pulled in.

        Each result may appear in multiple files or scopes that

        all use the same version of the affected package.


        The search results do not include full details on the dependencies

        that pull in each release, only a summary. To get the full dependency

        details, use the /releases/{key} endpoint for a single release.


        In the terminology of this endpoint, a "release" is a version of

        a package like "lodash 1.2.3", and a "dependency" is a specific file

        and scope that pulls in the release such as "subproject/pom.xml test".

        Each returned release may have multiple dependencies.

        Search for software composition analysis issues (dependency risks)
        of a project, paired with releases that appear in the analyzed
        project, application, or portfolio.

        This endpoint returns one result for each (issue,release) pair,
        rather than one result for each distinct issue. So for example
        if a library uses two different versions of a package and
        both versions are affected by the same vulnerability, you will
        get two results not one.

        However each result may appear in multiple files or scopes that
        all use the same version of the affected package.

        In the terminology of this endpoint, a "release" is a version of
        a package like "lodash 1.2.3", an "issue" is a problem such as
        "CVE-1234", and a "dependency" is a specific file and scope that
        pulls in the release such as "subproject/pom.xml test".
